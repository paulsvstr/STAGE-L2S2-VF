# STAGE-L2S2-VF
Here is my final repository, gathering the results of my internship.
- ALGO_A1 is based on Wikidata despcription
- ALGO_A2 is based on YAGO knowledge base
- ALGO_A3 is based on GloVe word embedding and a KNN algorithm

The data I used to benchmark those 3 algorithms is in the Python file :
- DataTestSet.py

The score obtained by each method is gathered in two files :
- FINAL_RESULTS.pdf
- FINAL_RESULTS.xlsx
